# QSLMaker
QSL card creator, fills out a pre-existing JPG image using ADIF

Right now this takes the .adif output file from WSJT-X.  May work for other ADIF files.

Change code for input file & other required files (e.g., font files [not included]).  Improvements to come later.

## Usage:  
python3 qslmaker.py
